# Port Forwading with SSH

> Not the one with `iptables` ðŸ™‚.


We actually tunell the traffic from a port on a remote station to a port on the local machine (**localhost**),
or vice versa.


Types of port forwarding:
- [Local Port Forwarding](./PortFowarding/local-port-fowarding.md)
  - I want access remote resources that I can't access
- [Remote Port Forwarding](./PortFowarding/remote-port-forwarding.md) (a.k.a **Reverse SSH**/**Reverse Port Forwading**)
  - I want people to acccess local resources that they don't have access to  
  - E.g.: local web server
