# Installing Docker


## Docker Engine
---
- It's the core container runtime that allows you to build, run, and manage containers.
- Includes the Docker daemon, REST API, and CLI tools.
- Runs on Linux by default, but can also be used on Windows and macOS (via WSL2 or a VM).
- Typically used on servers or production environments where you donâ€™t need a graphical interface.

## Docker Desktop
---
- A full package that includes Docker Engine along with a GUI and other tools.
- Available for Windows and macOS (uses a lightweight VM to run Docker Engine).
- Includes additional features like Kubernetes integration, Docker Compose, and Volume Management UI.
- Primarily designed for developers working on their local machines.
